# 100 Days of Python Challenge

Welcome to my 100 Days of Python Challenge repository! Here, I document my daily progress and share the code and projects I've worked on each day.

## About the Challenge

The "100 Days of Python" challenge is a commitment to learning and coding in Python every day for 100 days. My goal is to improve my Python skills, explore new libraries and frameworks, and build interesting projects.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by day, with each day's work contained in its own directory:
├── Day01
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── project_files
├── Day02
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── project_files
...
├── Day100
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── project_files


Each day's directory includes:
- **README.md**: A brief description of the day's activities and learnings.
- **project_files**: The code and any additional files related to the day's project.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**: git clone https://github.com/sanskritidabhade/100DaysPythonChallenge.git

2. **Navigate to the desired day's directory**: cd 100DaysPythonChallenge/DayXX

3. **Run the Python scripts**: python script_name.py
